Hi!, This is Muhammad Hussain, I like coding, reading books, music, food, meditation and sleep,
I live in Euless, TX with my family (my beautiful wife and our two wonderful kids),
I have 2 degrees, in business management and trade and commerce,
With 13 plus years of experience, I have expertise in business management, strategies, development, operations and IT management.
Currently, I am learning how to code at SMU bootcamp and I am loving it!. My teacher is great and TA's are very helpful and friendly!<br>
Since I was around 8 or 9 years old, I started to build interest in learning how to play flute and Bagpipe, My other interest or hobbies are singing western and eastern songs, playing Cricket and Soccer,
I do not like to go to sleep if I don't read at least 10 pages of an interesting book, I normally like to read books on business development,
however, books on the topics like self improvement, meditation and spirituality are also few of my favorite topics.<br>
Helping others and serving voluntarily to other fellow beings gives me immense satisfaction and both my wife and I always make sure to demonstrate such values and be a good role model for our kids.</p>
